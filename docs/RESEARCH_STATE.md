# Research State

Last handoff update: 2026-10-09.

## Mission
Emergence Lab investigates whether the fundamental laws and structures of physical reality—including spacetime, matter, and interactions—can emerge from simpler underlying principles, relations, or computational processes.

The Ising benchmark is a calibration step. The long-term question encompasses foundational spacetime, matter, interactions, and the principles that might give rise to them; candidate models still require rigorous mathematical and empirical evaluation.

## Documentation iteration (2026-10-09)
- Added `docs/OVERVIEW.md` to separate foundational-physics vision, specific research questions, validation methodology and roadmap.
- Refined `AGENTS.md` to require top-down observables, controls, evidence levels, bounded experiments, and reproducible session handoffs.
- Documentation-only change; no new experiment, proof, or deployment verification resulted from this iteration.

## Implemented (repository code)
- 2D ferromagnetic Ising model, periodic lattice, Metropolis updates.
- Deterministic seeded CPU experiments with JSON configs.
- CSV measurements and JSON manifest, basic pytest tests, Docker container capped at 0.5 vCPU and 1536 MB.
- Smoke and larger nightly experiment configs; GitHub CI.
- Manual GitHub Actions Lightsail deployment targeting /opt/emergence-lab; deploy workflow checks prerequisites, builds, runs smoke, then installs cron for 02:00 UTC.

## Verified operational status (2026-10-09)
- [Lightsail deployment run 37985438961](https://github.com/shaden7/emergence-lab/actions/runs/37985438961), on commit 1533d6f17bd1b23029f9ae86613db0fc2a240de3, completed **success** at 20:12 UTC. The remote build/smoke step succeeded; it checks smoke manifest and measurements files and only then installs the scheduled 02:00 UTC cron file.
- The server's actual output contents and subsequent cron execution remain **uninspected**. Deployment is still older than the proposed statistics patch. No automatic deployment was triggered.
- No full finite-size scaling, Lean integration or autonomous LLM hypothesis generator exists.

## Scientific cautions
Monte Carlo samples are autocorrelated; the initial averages do not demonstrate a phase transition or novel physical findings. The infinite-lattice Ising benchmark critical temperature is 2/log(1+sqrt(2)) in units J=k_B=1.

## Next priority
1. Review and merge milestone 2 statistical code only if PR CI passes; manually deploy after review, and verify actual remote manifest and cron records without affecting EatSleepFeel.
2. Pre-register a longer independent-seed holdout, verify equilibration sensitivity and autocorrelation-window stability.
3. Establish calibrated uncertainty, finite-size scaling and plotted model comparisons with a noninteracting-spin negative control.
4. Only then prototype emergent geometry/causal-structure models and Lean statements.

## Handoff requirements
After each meaningful research iteration, record: question, exact commit and config, computational resource budget, observed results, uncertainty and negative controls, scientifically supported conclusion, limitations, and next experiment. Keep large raw result files in versioned artifact storage rather than bloating Git history.

## Milestone 2: first uncertainty diagnostics (2026-10-09; proposed PR)

**Research question:** How does temporal autocorrelation reduce the information content of sampled finite Ising chains near the benchmark critical temperature?

**Implementation:** New per-chain integrated-autocorrelation heuristic and effective sample count, adjusted within-chain SEM, and independent-seed Student-t approximate 95% intervals across *chain means* (never naïvely pooled sweeps); outputs measurements.csv, summary.csv and a manifest containing statistical method and caveats. Trapped or short chains report missing diagnostics. Simulation and nightly compute configs are unchanged.

**Controls / falsification criterion:** Synthetic i.i.d. Gaussian versus AR(1) correlated series must show reduced effective count under correlation; constant series must not report false certainty; same simulation seed must return same results; CI/smoke outputs must exist. Statistical confidence is provisional without empirical coverage checks and equilibration tests.

**Evidence (executed locally, not on Lightsail):** 10 pytest tests passed; 12-chain configs/smoke.json run completed and wrote 6 aggregate rows. Config SHA-256 31d500fb653db1368d46364c561c825770faa289a6775529192e5b1cb7ae8b5b, base repository commit 9d541146556e32187812175ea99a41ddf5daaa51, proposed branch research/ising-statistics-m2-20261009, Python 3.13.5, NumPy 2.3.5; local GIT_SHA was unset and therefore null in local manifest. Details: [experimental note](experiments/2026-10-09-ising-uncertainty.md).

**Numerical observation:** At L=16, T=2.269185, each of two independently seeded chains produced 40 measured configurations. Heuristic effective counts for |M| were ~4.56 and ~3.86, implying strong serial dependence for this short run. Between-chain |M| mean ~0.68555 and a very wide unconstrained approximate 95% interval [-0.00436,1.37545]. This is **not** a phase-transition inference or a new physical result.

**Limits and cost:** Only two short-run replicates and 100 burn-in sweeps, no demonstrated equilibration/normality or interval coverage, and potentially underestimated long autocorrelation tails. Local budget 12 chains × 300 sweeps with L=8/16. Nightly budget unchanged: 128 chains with 1000 sweeps, Docker 0.5 CPU/1536 MB and 7200 s script timeout. No remote experiment was started during this iteration.

**Next discriminating experiment:** Pre-register independent holdout seeds, 4–8 chains, longer burn-in and sampling near critical T, compare correlation-window and burn-in sensitivity, then use finite-size scaling and a noninteracting-spin negative control. No fundamental-physics claim is supported by current numbers.
