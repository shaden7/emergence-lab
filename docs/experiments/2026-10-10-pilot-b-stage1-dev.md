# Pilot B stage 1 — implementation and development-set check (2026-10-10)

**Status:** PROPOSED (open PR, not on `main`). Development key only; **no blind key exists and no blind evaluation has run.**
**Session:** `rd-claude-20261010T195637Z-0eea4a` (producer of this code; a different session must do the later-pass review).
**Frozen design:** [preregistration v1.0-r1](../PILOT_B_BLINDED_INTERVENTION_PREREGISTRATION.md) (Git blob `dd5dbefe950add3341366224b76ba179326282c8`), [config](../../configs/pilot_b.json) (SHA-256 `3fc24afa33c31c91eb0f96be8ac7b785a7abb13083725fd39d6df406640d6d2e`). Both are verified at run time; any change fails closed. Neither file is modified by this stage.
**Scope:** methodology only. Every instance is a stipulated linear dynamics on a ring. Nothing here concerns physical spacetime, signalling or causality in nature.

## What was implemented

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/emergence_lab/pilot_b.py` | `instances(key)` generator, noisy `Oracle`, two exact reference paths, evaluator for B-G0…B-G5, manifest (B-G6), CLI (`--phase dev`; `--phase blind --allow-blind --beacon` refuses unverified beacons) |
| `src/emergence_lab/pilot_b_analyst.py` | Frozen decision rule (§5). Imports only `math` and NumPy; it sees an instance only through `oracle.readouts(t, r, arm)` |
| `src/emergence_lab/pilot_b_beacon.py` | drand quicknet pins, round↔time arithmetic, `randomness == SHA-256(signature)` check, BLS (G1 signature / G2 key, RFC 9380 hash-to-G1) verification with `py_ecc`, relay comparison |
| `tests/test_pilot_b.py` | 22 tests: pins, z values, analyst import isolation (AST and subprocess), generator determinism/counts, both reference paths for every class with exact exterior zeros, noise-free oracle exactness, budget enforcement, analyst verdict boundaries at z₁·SE, dev gates + byte identity, blind-phase refusal, beacon arithmetic, BLS self-test |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Dev run twice + `cmp` + notice annotation |
| `.github/workflows/pilot-b-beacon-check.yml` | PR / dispatch job: compares the pins with four relays' `/info` and BLS-verifies the latest round |

`scipy` was added as a runtime dependency (`expm` for the N1 matrix path, as §8 B-G0 names). `py_ecc` was added to the `test` and new `beacon` extras.

### Implementation choices the preregistration leaves open (fixed here, before any blind key exists)

- **Parameter stream:** one `default_rng(SeedSequence([key_int, 1]))`. Classes are drawn in config order S1, S2, S3, C1, C2, N1, N2, N3, with per-class draw order as coded in `_draw_params`. Then `perm = rng.permutation(40)`, and instance `i` is the `perm[i]`-th drawn instance.
- **Key integer:** `key_int = int.from_bytes(key[:16], "big")` for the parameter stream and the noise streams (§7 uses `key_int` for both).
- **Noise streams:** cell index `c = time_index·11 + site_index`; arm index control = 0, do = 1.
- **Circulant convention:** `x_{t+1}(i) = Σ_j a_j x_t(i−j)`. Ring Laplacian `(Δu)(i) = u(i+1) + u(i−1) − 2u(i)`. N3 symmetric stencil: draw `w_0…w_k`, mirror, normalise.
- **Control arm:** starts from 0, so its noise-free value is 0 for every linear member. For C2 the do arm equals the control arm, so S ≡ 0. The S1-type dynamics drawn for C2 is recorded but cannot affect any readout.
- **B-G2 for S2:** the true radius is `k = 1` per step.
- **B-G3 spurious definition:** exactly as in §8. C1 also counts an exterior detection under z₁, which implies `r > 0`.

## Development-set run (key `SHA-256(b"pilot-b-dev-2027101101")` = `266f9a9f…34c9f6`)

**Actually executed:** local cloud sandbox (Python 3.13.16, NumPy 2.5.3, SciPy 1.18.1). Two invocations produced byte-identical `rows.csv` (SHA-256 `fa657d024027ce3e587472912e522da61f44f7806b9f662f21f9a72a8cd53404`, 1 + 1,320 rows) and `result.json` (`247bda1c7bd9145ae64316cf5ab0bcee2e7c517b9a91d748c62aaa3bb8462309`). CPU 0.6 s, max RSS 68 MiB, outputs 152 KiB. These are inside the §9 budget (120 s / 512 MiB / 5 MiB). The CI run on the PR head re-executes this on Python 3.12; its digests are in the step annotation. Cross-version byte identity is **not** claimed until that annotation is compared.

| Gate | Dev outcome | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B-G0 | PASS | max \|matrix − spectral\| = 1.1e-14 over 40 instances × 3 t × 256 sites; every exterior site (ring distance > 4t) of all 24 P instances is exactly 0.0 in the matrix path; noise-free oracle exact (unit test) |
| B-G1 | PASS | 0 / 24 H0-satisfying instances rejected |
| B-G2 | PASS | 1 / 16 strict instances overestimated (instance 36, S2, c² = 0.427: cell t=4, r=12 has S = 0 exactly and z = 3.46 > z₂ = 3.1718; an interior false positive at the nominal rate, not an exterior rejection) |
| B-G3 | PASS | all 4 C1 detect r = 0 at every t; 0 / 8 spurious C instances |
| B-G4 | PASS | 6 detectable N instances (5 N2 and 1 N3 with d = 24, ε = 9.8e-3): 6 / 6 `H0_REJECTED` |
| B-G5 | PASS | verdicts ⊆ {NO_RESPONSE, CONSISTENT_WITH_H0, H0_REJECTED}; 10 undetected N instances listed with analytic max exterior \|S\| |
| B-G6 | dev part PASS | manifest with pins, versions, CPU, output hashes; byte identity on two invocations. The `code_commit` field is `null` locally and set from `GIT_SHA` in CI |

**Undetected non-strict dev instances (descriptive, the intended lesson, not a gate):** all five N1 (γ = 0.21…0.58; max exterior \|S\| 8e-8…1.7e-5, every one below the detection limit 5.73e-5) and five N3 whose shortcut site `d ∈ {20, 49, 73, 84, 94}` puts every grid exterior cell at exactly S = 0 within t ≤ 4. These are **undetected violations**, not evidence of bounded support. Rejection counts by class: N2 5/5, N3 1/6 (Wilson 95 % [0.03, 0.56]), N1 0/5 ([0, 0.43]).

**Independent cross-check (separate script, not the module's reference code):** direct time-stepping with `np.roll` (Taylor series with 80 terms for N1, the leapfrog recursion for S2, explicit shortcut update for N3) reproduced every `S_true` in `rows.csv` to 6.1e-14. It also re-checked all parameter ranges, the symmetry of the N3 stencils, ε < w₀, and the class counts. It shares the parameter draws, so it checks propagation and reporting, not the generator's sampling.

**Evidence level:** numerical check of an implementation on a public development key. It is not the blind test and not a physics result. Same model family wrote the design, code and this check (see prereg §6.5).

## Beacon (prereg §6.3) — status

- **Implemented and unit-tested locally:**
  - round arithmetic: round 1 at genesis, `round_time(R) = genesis + (R−1)·period`, and R is the first round with timestamp ≥ merge time + 24 h;
  - `randomness = SHA-256(signature)`;
  - BLS verification. A synthetic-keypair self-test accepts the valid signature and rejects a wrong round or wrong randomness.
- **Not yet verified:**
  - *Pinned quicknet values:* chain hash `52db9ba7…84e971`, public key `83cf0f28…ece45a`, period 3 s, genesis 1692803367, scheme `bls-unchained-g1-rfc9380`. These are typed from the model's prior knowledge, which is **not evidence**. The sandbox proxy blocks drand.
  - *Real-chain BLS check:* `py_ecc`'s hash-to-G1 has not yet been checked against a real quicknet signature.
- **How they will be checked:** the `Pilot B drand quicknet check` workflow on this PR does both. It compares the pins with the `/info` served by four relays (it requires ≥ 2 to match) and BLS-verifies the latest round. **If it fails, the pilot stays BLOCKED** (no substitute seed). The pins may then be corrected only from relay-served values, with the discrepancy recorded.
- **Stage 2 gap:** a workflow that runs the blind phase exactly once on `main`, fetches round R via `fetch-round` and archives the outputs is **not** part of this PR. It belongs to stage 2 and must not run before R is published.

## Limitations

- Analyst isolation is enforced at the import and interface level. Python cannot stop deliberate introspection of the oracle object, so a reviewer should read the 60-line analyst.
- The dev set is a single draw of 40 instances. Gate passes on it check correctness, not calibration rates (the expected B-G1 count is ≈ 1.2).
- The detector model (known σ, Gaussian white noise) is imposed, as in N5.

## Next step

A later-pass review by a different Director session. It should cover:
- the beacon workflow outcome, and correcting the pins if needed;
- the analyst code;
- the implementation choices above against the preregistration text;
- the Python 3.12 CI digests.

Then merge with an expected-head guard. The merge commit's timestamp fixes R; the blind run (stage 2) happens only after round R is published.
